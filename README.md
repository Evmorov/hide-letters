# Hide letters within a sentence

A small web-site that hides letters within a word or sentence. It could be useful when using a program like Anki and you use a  difficult word or expression.

Rules:
* The first letter is always opened
* 1 < number of letters <= 5 - one extra letter is opened
* 5 < number of letters <= 10 - two extra letters are opened
* 10 < number of letters <= 15 - three extra letters are opened
* 20 < number of letters and more - four extra letters are opened
